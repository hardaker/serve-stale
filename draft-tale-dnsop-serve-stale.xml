<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Traditionally the Time To Live (TTL) of a DNS resource record has been
understood to represent the maximum number of seconds that a record
can be used before it must be discarded, based on its description and
usage in <xref target="RFC1035"/> and clarifications in <xref target="RFC2181"/>.
Specifically, <xref target="RFC1035"/> Section 3.2.1 says that it "specifies the
time interval that the resource record may be cached before the source
of the information should again be consulted".</t>

<t>Notably, the original DNS specification does not say that data past
its expiration cannot be used.  This document proposes a method for
how recursive resolvers should handle stale DNS data to balance the
competing needs of resiliency and freshness. It is predicated on the
observation that authoritative server unavailability can cause outages
even when the underlying data those servers would return is typically
unchanged.</t>

<t>There are a number of reasons why an authoritative server may become
unreachable, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, network
issues, and so on.  This document suggests that, if the recursive
server is unable to contact the authoritative server but still has
data for the query name, it essentially extends the TTL of the
existing data on the assumption that "stale bread is better than no
bread".</t>

<t>Several major recursive resolver operations currently use stale data
for answers in some way, including Akamai, OpenDNS, and Xerocole.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>For a comprehensive treatment of DNS terms, please see <xref target="RFC7719"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="description" title="Description">

<t>Three notable timers drive considerations for the use of stale data,
as follows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A client response timer, which is the maximum amount of time a
recursive resolver should allow between the receipt of a resolution
request and sending its response.</t>
  <t>A query resolution timer, which caps the total amount of time a
recursive resolver spends processing the query.</t>
  <t>A maximum stale timer, which caps the amount of time
that records will be kept past their expiration.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Recursive resolvers already have the second timer; the first and
third timers are new concepts for this mechanism.</t>

<t>When a request is received by the recursive resolver, it SHOULD start
the client response timer.  This timer is used to avoid client
timeouts.  It SHOULD be configurable, with a recommended value of 1.8
seconds.</t>

<t>The resolver then checks its cache for an unexpired answer. If it
finds none and the Recursion Desired flag is not set in the request,
it SHOULD immediately return the response without consulting the
cache for expired records.</t>

<t>If iterative lookups will be done, it SHOULD start the query
resolution timer.  This timer bounds the work done by the resolver,
and is commonly around 10 to 30 seconds. [ BIND 9 used to use a
hard-coded constant of 30 seconds and has more recently added a
configuration parameter that defaults to 10 seconds and is capped at
30. A rigorous exploration of other implementations has not yet been
done. ]</t>

<t>If the answer has not been completely determined by the time the
client response timer has elapsed, the resolver SHOULD then check its
cache to see whether there is expired data that would satisfy the
request.  If so, it adds that data to the response message and SHOULD
set the TTL of each expired record in the message to 1 second.  The
response is then sent to the client while the resolver continues its
attempt to refresh the data.  1 second was chosen because historically
0 second TTLs have been problematic for some implementations.  It not
only sidesteps those potential problems with no practical negative
consequence, it would also rate limit further queries from any client
that is honoring the TTL, such as a forwarding resolver.</t>

<t>The maximum stale timer is used for cache management and is
independent of the query resolution process. This timer is
conceptually different from the maximum cache TTL that exists in many
resolvers, the latter being a clamp on the value of TTLs as received
from authoritative servers.  The maximum stale timer SHOULD be
configurable, and defines the length of time after a record expires
that it SHOULD be retained in the cache.  The suggested value is 7
days, which gives time to notice the resolution problem and for human
intervention for fixing it.</t>

<t>This same basic technique MAY be used to handle stale data associated
with delegations.  If authoritative server addresses are not able to
be refreshed, resolution can possibly still be successful if the
authoritative servers themselves are still up.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="implementation-caveats" title="Implementation Caveats">

<t>Answers from authoritative servers that have a DNS Response Code of
either 0 (NOERROR) or 3 (NXDOMAIN) MUST be considered to have
refreshed the data at the resolver.  In particular, this means that
this method is not meant to protect against operator error at the
authoritative server that turns a name that is intended to be valid
into one that is non-existent, because there is no way for a resolver
to know intent.</t>

<t>[ Paul Vixie has suggested that it be made explicit that an auth
NXDOMAIN cause all data, even stale data, below the NXDOMAIN to also
be removed, a la
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vixie-dnsext-resimprove/.
Conceptually this certainly has its appeal but addressing it in this
document when resimprove has not progressed has procedural problems.
This paragraph will be removed in the next draft, either dropping the
idea here completely or blessing it based on positive feedback to do
so. ]</t>

<t>Resolution is given a chance to succeed before stale data is used to
adhere to the original intent of the design of the DNS.  This
mechanism is only intended to add robustness to failures, and to be
enabled all the time.  If stale data were used immediately and then a
cache refresh attempted after the client response has been sent, the
resolver would frequently be sending data that it would have had no
trouble refreshing.</t>

<t>It is important to continue the resolution attempt after the stale
response has been sent, until the query resolution timeout, because
some pathological resolutions can take many seconds to succeed as they
cope with unavailable servers, bad networks, and other problems.
Stopping the resolution attempt when the response with expired data
has been sent would mean that answers in these pathological cases
would never be refreshed.</t>

<t>Canonical Name (CNAME) records mingled in the expired cache with other
records at the same owner name can cause surprising results.  This was
observed with an initial implementation in BIND, where a hostname
changed from having a CNAME record to an IPv4 Address (A) record.
BIND does not evict CNAMEs in the cache when other types are received,
which in normal operations is not an issue.  However, after both
records expired and the authorities became unavailable, the fallback
to stale answers returned the older CNAME instead of the newer A.</t>

<t>[ This probably applies to other occluding types, so more thought
should be given to the overall issue. It should probably also be
rewritten to not suggest that this only a quirk of BIND. ]</t>

<t>Keeping records around after their normal expiration will of course
cause caches to grow larger than if records were removed at their TTL.
Specific guidance on managing cache sizes is outside the scope of this
document.  Some areas for consideration include whether to track the
popularity of names in client requests versus evicting by maximum age,
and whether to provide a feature for manually flushing only stale
records.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="implementation-status" title="Implementation Status">

<t>[RFC Editor: per RFC 6982 this section should be removed prior to
publication.]</t>

<t>The algorithm described in this draft was originally implemented as a
patch to BIND 9.7.0.  It has been in production on Akamai's production
network since 2011, and effectively smoothed over transient failures
and longer outages that would have resulted in major incidents. The
patch has been contributed to the Internet Systems Consortium in
anticipation that it will be incorporated to their main BIND
distribution.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>The most obvious security issue is the increased likelihood of DNSSEC
validation failures when using stale data because signatures could be
returned outside their validity period.  This would only be an issue
if the authoritative servers are unreachable, the only time the
techniques in this document are used, and thus does not introduce
a new failure in place of what would have otherwise been success.</t>

<t>Additionally, bad actors have been known to use DNS caches to keep
records alive even after their authorities have gone away.  This makes
that easier.</t>
